# iot-project
My first IoT project
# IoT Project using ESP32

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic Internet of Things (IoT) system using the ESP32
microcontroller. The system collects sensor data, processes it, and can be extended
for real-time monitoring applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand ESP32 programming
- To interface sensors with ESP32
- To build a scalable IoT project structure
- To use Git and GitHub for version control

## 🛠 Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Development Board
- Sensors (Temperature, Humidity, etc.)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C / C++
- Git & GitHub

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The ESP32 reads data from connected sensors and processes the data. The processed
data can be displayed on a serial monitor or transmitted to a cloud platform for
remote monitoring.
